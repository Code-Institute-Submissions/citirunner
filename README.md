#  CitiRunner 

![Image of versions ](C:\Users\Maria\Pictures\Running\Multi-Device-Website-Mockup-Generator.png)

The CitiRunner  website  is designed to be an  add-on to the website of  a city-center hotel.

 Most hotels have a" digital concierge" section to their website  offering guest services such as local attractions, eating choices and entertainment    

The CitiRunner website is specifically for hotel guests who want to  exercise during their stay in a city center hotel. 
The site provides a  local weather update 

Based on the weather today the guest can choose  

- a run route from the hotel  and select a run distance 
-  to visit a local gym or yoga class

-  to find a Personal Trainer 


**Rationale for the site** 

The “Hotels’ Digital Divide” report, commissioned by [ALICE](https://www.aliceplatform.com/) and conducted by research firm [YouGov](http://www.yougov.com/), highlights the shifting expectations of modern hotel guests, as well as travelers’ technology preferences and the role that technology plays in providing more personalized travel experiences. In order to meet evolving guest expectations, hotels should equip *their concierge* with the most up-to-date information about nearby attractions and cultural experiences.

 A fitness section added to a hotel website as part of the  digital concierge,  provides valuable information to a sector of hotel clients and offers potential to engage with them in the future in a very cost effective manner,

Citirunner provides a means for hotels without a gym to address fitness choices of their guests.

 Even if the hotel has its own gym, many people like to run outdoors instead of a treadmill. CitiRunner  website allows the hotel guest to check the weather and then offers a choice of fitness options to exercise safely in an unfamiliar city and know when they will return.

## **## Goals of the website** 





#### ## 1. Goal of the Business Owner**

**Goals of the business owner** are very specific 

1.To enhance the service offerings to  hotel guests  by providing them with free, easily accessible information on  fitness activities during their stay.


2.To improve marketing reach for the company by capturing  guests' email by giving them a valuable discount to local gyms and yoga studios and on Personal Training sessions.  





To meet these 2 goals the CitiRunner website is made available to  guests of the hotel, it acts as an addition to the hotels digital concierge, and provides a cost effective way to increase value to the hotel guests, it  is an efficient way to update information and  offers a valuable gym discount in exchange for the user email. 

*CitiRunner provides:*  

Weather information for the hotel location
Choice of recommended run distances and routes in their location
 A Google map of the area with gym locations and info windows with phone and website link.
Suggestions for personal trainers in the  area, recommended by the hotel 
An email optin  for the user in exchange for a  discount on local gyms or yoga studios 



Effective UI has to align the goals of the user  with the  goals of the  business -- CitiRunner  provides valuable information  that makes hotel guest experience more enjoyable and  provides a strong incentive ( gym discount) in exchange for email address . 

The business hopes that a  current customer will use CitiRunner and  that using the site enhances their stay and makes future marketing possible. 



#### 2. The goals of the website user



**User Goals** 

A hotel guest can check that the weather is suitable for running 

 if the weather is good  they can  select a run route & distance and how long they will be gone.  
If the weather is not suitable they can choose different fitness options nearby -- gyms and keep fit studios or yoga studios from a Google Map that renders this information for their location
Or they can choose a Trainer recommended by the hotel and check resume and prices on social media page. 
The hotel guest can opt-in to receive a discount on the local gyms and get offers from the hotel in the future.



***\*The website attempts to meet the users goals\**** by providing 



 \1. Quick, easy and obvious navigation  

The entry screen asks fortheir  hotel location by means of a dropdown button 

This action leads to a section that gives the  local weather and based on that weather the user can decide to run or to take another form of activity  

 \2. Images on the website and text are for clarifying the function of the website to  the user 

 \3. Easy to read information on the website in terms of choices and availability  

 \4. Reassurance that their email will not be spammed if they give it to claim the gym discount

 \6. A sign up form in the footer for users that don't want the gym discount but do want 

  give their email to receive offers from the hotel in future



It is hoped that a combination of these factors will meet both user and business goals



### **## UX**



The website will only be used by hotel guests:



-  Staying in a hotel in an unfamiliar city who want to run a short distance for exercise 

-  Who want to check the weather before they leave 

- Who want to know what route to take to run and what distance
- Or who want to visit a local gym or yoga or pilates studio 
- Who want to book a  fitness session with a Personal Trainer 



***\*Users are offered very specific  information\**** 

1. The weather in their local area (if the hotel is located in NY then the weather will be only for NY - they are limited to only local weather)
2. Fitness choices based on that weather

  3.Run Routes around the hotel location and distances 

  4.Local Gyms and Yoga and Pilate studios 

  5.Personal Trainers Available 

6. An option to receive a discount on a training session or a gym pass in exchange for their email.

## **## Features of the Website:** 

**Strategy**

The main function of the website is  to allow  hotel guests to access fitness choices easily and safely. If  the user goals are achieved, the goal of the business will also be met  and that is to  increase service offerings and engage with their guests and  to collect user emails and add them to their marketing funnel to generate business.  

**Scope** 

The content and layout of the website is designed to give value to its users and to establish a means for the company to maintain an ongoing connection with users of the website 

Hotels know how  important it is  to meet the needs of all kinds of guests and to communicate with them in the future. Email capture is still a very important part of marketing  to allow the business to give more information E.g. hotel special offers and discounts.

**Structure**  

The site is one page and the user will spend a very short time looking at the content -- every item on the site will be viewed for only a  few seconds- so each item must be functional.  

**Skeleton**

- [Desktop Version](https://mr19331.github.io/citirunner/wireframes/wireframe-desktop.png)  
- [Tablet Version](https://mr19331.github.io/citirunner/wireframes/wireframe-tablet.png)  
- [Mobile Version](https://mr19331.github.io/citirunner/wireframes/wireframe-mobile.png) 

**Surface** 

The appearance of the site is very important, if the site doesn't appear professional and appealing then the user may not continue. The website has to be as attractive and easy to use as the hotel main website. 

The images are carefully selected, text is presented in small palatable chunks that can be read quickly and the entire site can be scrolled in a few minutes.

Navigation is simple and predictable

The user is given clear CTA instructions 

The user is given very limited choices to  simplify use and reduce costs.

 The weather API and Google map API and emailjs API will add to the cost of running the site, so the CitiRunner site will render information based on the hotel location rather than allowing the guest to search. 

The requirements for user information are minimal. 



1. **Navbar menu** with links to the different site sections 

   Users can move around the site easily to find the information they need 

   Navbar is clear and easily read, and collapses to a convenient toggle menu icon on mobile

   Menu is fixed and moves with the user as they scroll down the page for accessibility





2.**A jumbotron section** with large text and subheading 

Allows user to click and select their hotel location from a dropdown menu

User sees exactly what to do quickly & with minimal effort 



3.**The hero image** in the first 2 sections  

Clarifies the nature of the website immediately

Button size and color draws user attention. 



1. **CTA buttons** 

   All the buttons are in a bright color and with a clear message

   5.**Weather Checker** is brightly colored with an icon and the degrees are clickable to change from Celsius to Fahrenheit and will render local weather.

   

   6.**Run Gallery Section** 

   Presents the run routes as a series of images that pop up to full size  

   Users can make their selection easily 

     

   7.**Local Gym Google map** 

   Allows user to scan quickly and click the marker to view location information and has a link to the gym website 

   ​    8. **Alert** is used over the local gym map with a clickable link to the actual form below

   9. **Optin Form**  is simple to fill in just email and name and offers a big discount as an enticement for users to sign up

      When user submits the form using the button - a success message is shown to say their action was successful  

   10.**Personal Trainers**  Profile  image and some information about recommended trainers with social links if the user wishes to get more information 

    

   

   11. **Footer**-  supplies  links  to  social media sites,

    Gives phone and email of the company 
   
    






**## Features Left To Implement** 

- **Add other pages** for the remaining hotel locations in other cities
- **Remarketing pixels**  so that the hotel group can remind the user that they visited the site 
- **Add more interactivity** with the Google map, and more information. 
- **Add route animation** to the images 
- Add  **bike hire locations** as another fitness option 
- A **carousel**  for  testimonials
- **Link to options** for  other activities -- Hot Yoga, guided bike rides , roller blading etc 
- **Implement a booking system** for trainers and bike hire etc 





**## Technologies Used**

[openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org) - to create the weather app with their free API

[Google.com](https://google.com) - the API was used to create the Gym Location map with markers & infowindows

[emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com)- the email facility was created using emailjs.com API 

[http://fancyapps.com](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)   Lightbox used for the map images ( recommended by tutor Tim )

[Cacoo.com](https://cacoo.com) - to create a mockup of the different versions of the website, desktop, tablet & mobile 

[Typora](https://typora.com)- to create the README.md file to outline the site creation process 

[HTML]( https://html.com)  **Hypertext Markup Language**  the project uses HTML to write the standard markup language that allows the document to   to be displayed in a web browser.

[ CSS]()  **Cascading Style Sheets** is the style sheet language used in this project for describing the presentation of the document written in HTML 

[JavaScrip](https://www.javascript.com/)t a Java Script  cdn script was added as part of the Bootstrap scripts. In the website it allows  the toggle menu icon   to work correctly as used in the mobile view of the website. 

[JQuery](https://jquery.com) The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

[Canva.com](https://Canva.com ) for cropping images and constructing the large images.

[formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/)  for connecting the forms to make them work 

[Formatting](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html ) the code     Gitpod formatter does not work for me, so I copy pasted my code into this free website and replaced it.





## ## Testing



\- **Chrome developer tools** --on the Chrome browser was used constantly  during development to add styles to conveniently try changes immediately and to check basic layout of the website and to check site responsiveness on different screen sizes 

**Mozilla developer tools-** used particularly to assess the site  for accessibility in terms of text visibility ( contrast)

[Validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org ) used to check  HTML for  coding errors such as open tags and errors in classes etc.

 No errors or warnings showing for code 

[Jigsaw.w3.org](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Used to check CSS code for errors 

[Caniuse.com](https://Caniuse.com ) to check if features of the site are accessible on a browser



**Testing  Display** 

Chrome developer tools  used to check  elements in different  views 

Went through each section and tested and altered display based on what looked better 



**Navbar Links** connect to correct website section  - tested and  work 

**Dropdown links** appear can ,be clicked and go to correct section -tested and work 

**CTA buttons** in each  section   work and  jump to the correct section of the page  

Pointers show on hover, colors change  on hover and show state change after use

**Geolocator**  alert dropdown appears if user does not have it activated in the browser

and a notification appears on the weather app to ask them to activate their geolocator.

**Google map**  shows the markers for the gyms & yoga studio and infowindows open on click 

information is shown correctly in the window and links to each site work correctly

**Submit buttons**  in Contact form  and  all other buttons change state on clicking 

**Social link buttons** in Trainer section and Footer change state & have hover and pointer

**Social media link  buttons** work and connect to correct social site

**Contact** form** works  shows change in state sends an email to me asking for a gym discount 

**Error message** shows if  email not correct , if name not entered 

**Success message** shows when email submitted 

**Form fields** must be filled before the message or email can be sent  

**Email**  using [emailjs](https://emailjs.com) sends correctly to my gmail account when the form is filled and submit button clicked 



 **Accessibility**

- Used  HTML5 semantic elements title,  nav, footer, form, header, button, jumbotron  to clarify elements for screen readers, search engines & developers

- Used mozilla developer tools   to check readibility of text in terms of contrast 

- Used rems not px to allow user to zoom browser view. 

- Used screen reader labels on buttons and aria labels for screen readers to identify elements

- Used alt tags to describe images in case browser can't load and for SEO purposes. 

- Used simple text font and tested for visibility



#### Layout of the site in different versions 

Because  of the numbers of individual elements in the  run gallery section  and trainer section  

It was necessary to  control the display in different versions  

Final versions are:

**Desk top** -- all elements displayed 2 rows of 3 images,  3 trainers

**Tablet**  --  same display as  desktop  

**Mobile** display  4  gallery images,  2 rows of 2 images stacked , 2 trainers stacked 

**Changes to display**

Initially I had only  2 reviews in  the <u>tablet</u> view, I changed it back to 3 because the thumbnails are small 

Now there are 2 rows of 3 images in the gallery in  large and medium version and 2 rows 2 stacked in the mobile version

Initial design had the weather app in the same section as the hotel location selection  but I added the second selection screen because it looked too crowded. 





## ## Deployment

1.  On https://GitHub.com go to the site repository Click Settings 
2.  Scroll down to "GitHub Pages", use drop-down in Source menu and select publishing source 

3.  Use g-h pages branch for simplest publishing option and the link is created to live site automatically .


 There is also an option to publish to master branch /docs folder where it can be kept but the /docs must be created on the main branch first and if the /docs folder is removed then you will get error message and site will not be built. 



#### Local Deployment

-  On https://GitHub.com go to main page of the repository 

-  Under the name of the repository click Clone or download , the repository will be either opened on the desktop or can be downloaded and saved as a zip file.

### **## Problems with website** 

Testing different views revealed a problem of gapping on the RHS especially in mobile view

**Tried to fix** on my own -- adding overflow hidden, removing margins & padding  etc. looking for answers

 **Fix** asked the tutors for help and 

When I removed the .fixed-top  the gap improved 

But  the fixed- top navbar  is necessary so that the user can navigate to sections easily 

 I tried substituting sticky- top to a new class  and did not work. 

I restored the fixed- top navbar and added overflow hidden CSS code to the navbar section 

**Text visibility**

Smaller white text  was  not clear  on  the weather section 

**Tried to fix** by adding a dark overlay over the whole image  

 this made  background darker at back of the text but made scrolling problems 

Changed the image background using  a tool from Canva.com

Still not perfect but this can be a later update 



**Google location map**   I found the positioning of the map quite tricky.

 The map would not appear at first, then when I added multiple markers it disappeared and again when I added the alert to the header above the map it also disappeared 

**Fix** was just trial and error - correct padding and adding margins, improved the map stability. 



**Main image** caused a scroll- bar at the bottom of the container 

 **Fix** removed by adding overflow hidden, code to CSS

**Weather icons** were very difficult to manage at first - to get them to show and to have a small enough selection to match weather conditions 

**Fix** found a [source](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons) sharing  weather icons that could be downloaded and used 



**Display**  of the  run gallery images  I wanted the images to pop out when the user clicked 

and I wanted them to be thumbnail so they could be scanned easily before selection 

Fixed with  help of the bootstrap display information -- now show as two  rows of 3 on desktop and tablet  from and then go to one column of 4stacked  in mobile at screens smaller than 425px



**Gallery images** I made several different attempts to create a carousel effect within the modal of the image without success until Tim  ( tutor) suggested I use [Fancybox](https: // fancyapps.net )  and now it works perfectly

 

**Large background images** were completely skewed when the site was deployed -- I know now  that the real version of mobile can be different than the emulation shown in dev tools . I cropped the image and made several media queries  to adjust to each of 5 or different size versions and it  still did not solve the problem.

####  Fix 

Cropped the original image again and tried even smaller versions for the mobile and tablet views

used several articles on the subject  but at smaller sizes the mobile and tablet version images were pixelated even though I was using media queries.  

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24154666/background-size-cover-not-working-on-ios

I tried several different things suggested without getting a good solution and then changing the CSS in the media query from background-attachment: fixed; to background-scroll;   fixed the problem and the image now looks correct in chrome dev tools  but is still not fixed in the real mobile version . I spent a lot of time trying to correct this aspect of the site but have to leave it and try and find a solution in another version.
